When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Whenever I would like to show my work to others and contribute my work to public

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

When we change something in the repository in GitHub its not updated in the our
workspace on the machine so we need to pull changes to our workspace.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

forks are used to copy the repositories on GitHub. Clones are used to copy the
repositories from Github to our workspace. branches are used to create a new
branch in the same repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored
locally?

It is easy to find where the work had stopped and will be easy to continue the
work and the last copy can be used to see where the work was left out.
