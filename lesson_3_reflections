When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Whenever I would like to show my work to others and contribute my work to public

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    When we change something in the repository in GitHub its not updated in the
    our workspace on the machine so we need to pull changes to our workspace.
